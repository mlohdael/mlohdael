This was 'pushed' to the main branch (?), I think??! The terminology might not be right on that, but... yeah. still learning.


- 👋 Hi, I’m @mlohdael - real name Christopher Leadholm, I live in the Greater Detroit Metro Area. Am a full time learner.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Arduino, Raspiberry Pi's, ESP32, ESP8266 and other various microcontroller boards
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... C/C++ & Python - mostly, although i can comprehend a few other languages at least and what's happening in the code but am by no means an expert. Learning how to tie the front end to the back end depending on what boards/parts your using or have to make code with some random given hardware/wiring setup. I have a small oscilloscope and like to learn stuff about electricity flow and the componenets like capacitors transistors and resistors and all that's required in that... i have my own workshop basically. It's what i call the 'office' of my 1 dedroom appartment. I sleep in what is the living room, so it's like a studio appartment with an office attached.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... i'm still learning, so just randomly being asked to look at something is okay with me. ;-) i may just have an answer.
- 📫 How to reach me ... through this site itself, or any other stack-related sites.
